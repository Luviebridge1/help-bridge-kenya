HelpBridge Kenya - Files to add to repository

Instructions:
1. Keep your current index.html (homepage) unchanged.
2. Add the following files and folders to your repo root:
   - assets/logo.svg
   - css/style.css
   - js/main.js
   - donate.html
   - impact.html
   - register.html
   - about.html
   - contact.html
3. Push to GitHub and connect repo to Netlify (New site from Git > choose branch > Deploy).
4. If your index.html needs navbar links, add links to:
   - donate.html
   - impact.html
   - register.html
   - about.html
   - contact.html

Notes:
- Donations use M-Pesa Send Money to +254 758 820 459.
- Forms are placeholders; I can wire them to Google Sheets or email (ask me to set that up).
- For STK push / automated M-Pesa payments we need server-side integration and Safaricom credentials.
